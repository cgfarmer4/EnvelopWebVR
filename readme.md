#### What can I do with this repo?

- Quick inspection of spatial audio mixes aligned with graphical object movement.
- Perform live audio reactive visuals across multiple devices using WebVR.
- Create, save and export keyframe rendering data with tweening / easing support for WebGL object properties.
- Record Envelop vector movements, channel levels and reassign those values to WebGL object properties.
- Host a UDP / Web Socket server that talks to Max/Ableton and the web.
- Render scene in 4k 360 or 1080p. Merge with B format audio for YouTube, Vimeo and Facebook 360.
